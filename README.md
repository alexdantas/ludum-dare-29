Game entry for [the Ludum Dare #29 competition][ld29] ([here's the entry][entry]).
It's a simple HTML5 2D platformer, made in 72h and powered by [melonJS][melonjs].

It works on most web browsers, including on mobile devices.

as animals. She needs to descend into the depths of hell, fighting all sorts of
strange enemies on her way (mostly walking-fire-people).

| -------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Arrow keys** or **WASD** | Walk and jump |
| Hold **Shift**             | Run           |

## Instructions

[To play the game right now, follow this link][play].

If you want your own **local version**, [download the repository][repo], start a
web server and open `index.html` on your favorite browser.

Note that this repository is a **development version** of the game. It splits
the code over several `.js` files.

You can build a **production version**, that compresses all the
`.js` files into minified versions.
This way it'll be way faster to load the game.
It is the recommended way to host it on your own website.

To build, be sure you have [node](http://nodejs.org) installed.
On the project directory, run:

    npm install

And then:

    grunt
