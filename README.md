strange enemies on her way (mostly walking-fire-people).

| Hold **Shift**             | Run           |

## Instructions

[To play the game right now, follow this link][play].

If you want your own **local version**,
[download the repository][repo] and open `index.html` on your favorite browser.

Note that this repository is a **development version** of the game.  It splits
the code over several `.js` files.

You can build a **production version**, that compresses all the
`.js` files into minified versions.
This way it'll be way faster to load the game.
It is the recommended way to host it on your own website.

To build, be sure you have [node](http://nodejs.org) installed.
On the project directory, run:

    npm install

And then:

    grunt
